# Python Comments

## Single-Line Comments

To write a comment, just add a `#` at the start of the line.

**Examples:**

```python
# This is a 'Single-Line Comment'
print("Hello Gaurav !! Above is a single line comment")

print("Hello Gaurav !!")  # Printing Hello World

print("Gaurav! Below is a single line comment")
# print("Python Program")

```

## Multi-Line Comments:

To write multi-line comments you can use ‘#’ at each line or you can use the multiline string.

**Example 1:** The use of ‘#’.

```python
# Below is python code 
# assign te value of ab,c,d
a = 55
b = 44
c = 11
d = 9
```

**Example 2:** The use of multiline string.

```python
""" Below python program is an basic arthematic program 
that will do aurthematic operations in python ."""

a = 55
b = 44
c = 11
d = 9

print("The value of a+b is:  ", a + b)
print("The value of a-b is:  ", a - b)
print("The value of a/c is:  ", a / c)
print("The value of a", "%", "d is: ", a % d)

```
